# LwDITA ProseMirror Demo

This is a small demo to showcase the use of [evolvedbinary/prosemirror-lwdita](https://github.com/evolvedbinary/prosemirror-lwdita) features, and as a playground to test all of the features.

```shell
# clone project and install dependencies
git clone https://github.com/evolvedbinary/prosemirror-lwdita.git
cd prosemirror-lwdita
yarn install

# start the demo
yarn start:demo
```

This will start a demo on `http://localhost:1234`.
If this port is already in use, `parcel` will assign a random port that you can see in the terminal logs.
